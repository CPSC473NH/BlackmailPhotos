# BlackmailPhotos
Proof of concept: Blackmail Photo Sharing Site

First time set up with Node.js:
1. On the vagrant server, navigate to directory where the server files for blackmailPhotos are stored (folder with server.js and index.html)
2. Run 'npm install' to install dependencies
3. Make sure not to sync node_modules to github


After completing first time setup:
1. In the same directory, run 'nodemon' (nodemon lets you update the server while its live!)
